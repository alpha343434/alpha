 when I thought, I wish someone had told me that earlier. This is a collection
of such advice. Well, I hope it is more than such a collection. I wish to present
an attitude - a way of thinking and doing mathematics that works - not just a
collection of techniques (which I will present as well!)
If you are a beginner, then studying high-level mathematics probably involves using study skills new to you. I will not be discussing generic study
skills necessary for success – time management, note taking, exam technique
and so on; for this information you must look elsewhere.
I want you to be able to think like a mathematician and so my aim is to give
you a book jam-packed with practical advice and helpful hints on how to acquire";
