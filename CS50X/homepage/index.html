            <p>Cindy Sherman is an American conceptual artist. She is one of the most influential artists in the modern age of photography. This makes sense… because she has two images on the list of “The Top 10 Most Expensive Photographs in the World.” Her photography explores contemporary identity and the nature of representation. These are drawn from the unlimited supply of images from TV, magazines, the internet, and art history.
                She places herself in her own work and uses a range of disguises and personas. They were disturbing, distasteful, and sometimes amusing. And she’s not just a photographer. She’s also a model, hairdresser, stylist, and makeup artist.</p>

            <p>There was never a more prolific photographer than Robert Frank. From 1941, he worked as a commercial photographer in Zurich, Basel, and Geneva.
In 1947, he found a job as a fashion photographer in the US. He used a 35mm Leica that was unconventional at the time. Between 1950 and 1959, he turned his attention to street photography and photojournalism.
This is when he became most famous. The Guggenheim Fellowship allowed him to travel the country. And that resulted in his most famous work—The Americans (pictured below).
He worked closely with Walker Evans. And Robert Frank became one of the world’s most famous street photographers. He completed his visuals with text written straight onto the negatives and prints.</p>

            <p>Eliot Furness Porter was an American photographer famous for his colorful nature photos. He started photographing birds and landscapes with a Kodak box camera as a child.
Porter got a Leica camera in 1930. In 1933, he was inspired by the photographs of Ansel Adams. And Ansel Adams encouraged him to work with a large format camera.
Porter did so after meeting Alfred Stieglitz. And Stieglitz exhibited Porter’s work—called An American Place—at an art gallery in New York City in 1939.</p>
