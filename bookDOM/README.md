## This is a flask project

This project, named bookDOM, aims to combat the influence of societal pressures and discover hidden gems within the vast world of literature. When a user clicks the "recommend a book" button, the web application leverages the Google Books API to deliver a truly random book suggestion. This approach encourages exploration beyond the realm of popular titles and critically acclaimed authors, potentially leading to the discovery of under-appreciated works.
